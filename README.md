# Predictive modeling of hospital admission categories
Hospital admission category predictions are important because they give hospitals a better picture of their patients and handle their specific needs, whether elective, urgent, or emergency. I created a nominal multinomial model to predict the admissions category of a patient using information about the clinical case (length of stay and mortality), their demography (skin colour and age), and characteristics of the hospital they entered, and wrote a brief report on my findings.
