# Predictive modeling of hospital admission categories: A nominal multimodal approach
Hospital admission category predictions are important because they can help optimise resource allocation, improve patient flow, and ensure that hospitals are equipped to handle the specific needs of their patients, whether elective, urgent, or emergency. By anticipating admission types, healthcare systems can better plan staffing, prioritise critical cases, and reduce delays in treatment. 

I create a nominal multimodal to predict the admissions category of a patient using information about the clinical case (length of stay and mortality), their demography (skin colour and age), and characteristics of the hospital they entered.
